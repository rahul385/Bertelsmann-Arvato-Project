## Project Overview<a name="overview"></a>
The objective of the project is to determine the chances that a person from mailout campaign could become a new customer.

The project is divided into several subtasks:
1.	Data Analysis and Preprocessing;
2.	Customer Segmentation Report;
3.	Supervised Learning Predictive Model;
4.	Kaggle Competition;

The training data is protected under the Terms and Conditions and is unavailable for public sharing.

## The Process <a name="process"></a>

1. Customer Segmentation Report
You'll begin the project by using unsupervised learning methods to analyze attributes of established customers and the general population in order to create customer segments.

2. Supervised Learning Model
You'll have access to a third dataset with attributes from targets of a mail order campaign. You'll use the previous analysis to build a machine learning model that predicts whether or not each individual will respond to the campaign.

3. Kaggle Competition
Once you've chosen a model, you'll use it to make predictions on the campaign data as part of a Kaggle Competition. You'll rank the individuals by how likely they are to convert to being a customer, and see how your modeling skills measure up against your fellow students.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

Data is provided by Bertelsmann Arvato
* `Udacity_AZDIAS_052018.csv`
* `Udacity_CUSTOMERS_052018.csv`
* `Udacity_MAILOUT_052018_TRAIN.csv`
* `Udacity_MAILOUT_052018_TEST.csv`

2 more files for describing attributes:
* `DIAS Attributes - Values 2017.xlsx`
* `DIAS Information Levels - Attributes 2017.xlsx`

## Results <a name="results"></a>

The final predictions were made on the Udacity_MAILOUT_052018_TEST.csv. The score of the final performance of my model was 0.7859.
